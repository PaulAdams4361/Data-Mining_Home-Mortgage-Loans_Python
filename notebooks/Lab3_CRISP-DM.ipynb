While there may be some potential minimization of categorical importance from this approach (through introducing more parameters and slightly dilluting the correlation), any residual collinearity following variable elimination would be likewise minimized by further separating significance of categorical variables in preference to other collinear, continuous and nominally scaled integer features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the random forest output, the top 15 features were identified. We decided to analyze 15 features for outlier removal due to the exponentially decaying significance of subsequent features to the target and the negative impact of removing too many observations. We performed analysis on these 15 features using histograms to assess dispersion and measured skewness on all transformed features to identify the most practical transformations (root, logarithmic, squared) required for normalization.

Values beyond +/- three standard deviations are dropped from the model. This approach was selected because three standard deviations covers roughly 99.78% of all data, eliminating only extreme outliers. Three standard deviations is also within a reliable range for hypothesis testing. After dropping outlying observations from the data, we then back-transformed it to allow prior knowledge in the data to remain for its use in classification modeling.\n",
